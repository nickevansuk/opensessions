# Open Sessions

## Quick-start

### Setup
To start the project, download and use `npm install` in the root folder to install the dependencies.
### Configure Stormpath
Add a `stormpath.yml` with credentials as described (https://stormpath.com/blog/fullstack-express-angular-stormpath) to allow stormpath integration. (TODO: abstract Stormpath integration away to be non-breaking)
### Running
Run the server with `npm start`. After a few seconds, the server should be up and running and give you the access URLs for your app.
